# Website for OfficiumDivinum

This repository holds the source for the
[OfficiumDivinum](https://OfficiumDivinum.github.io) website, written in
markdown with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and the generated html (built
with Github Actions on every push).

Please do not directly edit content, as it will be overwritten. Instead, edit
the markdown files inside `/docs`. If you want to do something which doesn't
seem obvious, open an issue.
